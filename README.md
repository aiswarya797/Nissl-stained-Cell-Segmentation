# Nissl-stained-Cell-Segmentation
This repository contains all the code written during my thesis at CCBR, IIT Madras. 

## Command to run the code from command line :
    **python cell_segment_basic.py --path '/home/aiswarya/data_test'**

Here. --path contains the path to the input files. Segmented output images (a new copy of the images) are saved back to same folder.
